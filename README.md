# eegmir
This is the original copy of Jim Peters' EEGMIR v 0.1.12 downloaded from https://uazu.net/eegmir/
If you are interested in neurohacking there is a lot of material including this program on https://github.com/ab3nd/neurohacking

I only wanted to adapt this program for a Mind Mirror device, so I created this on Github on its own.
